  desc: |
    These functions allow customization of model priors. By default, Covidestim comes with a complete set of priors, which have been tailed for estimation of U.S. counties and states. However, these functions make it possible to override the default parameterizations of the prior distributions, within certain constraints. This allows you to conduct exploratory modeling of other geographies, or test the effect of different priors on estimates.
